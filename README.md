An informative homepage I created for Casa Tanko as a part of my part time web dev training job

The site supports various viewports, has some standard features like a modal image browsing view as well as a dynamic floating button for referring potential customers to Booking.com should they be interested in the accommodation's offerings. 
Unfortunately, Booking.com API isn't available for personal use so I couldn't implement features such as available booking days calendar view with conventional methods.
Some other potential features or functions were also scrapped, but I'm planning to potentially keep expanding this project for practice purposes.
