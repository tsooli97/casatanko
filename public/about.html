        <p>Casa Tanko is a 34-square metre self-catering apartment with all the amenities you need for a short or a long stay. It has a brand new queen size bed (160 cm) with quality linen and bedding, a fully-equipped kitchen with a microwave oven, a dishwasher and all the basic electrical appliances. A fast wifi is included in the price. A bus stop is located 150 metres from the entrance and a ride on a bus to Puotila metro station only takes 5 minutes and then you can take the underground to the city centre in 15 minutes. Alternatively, you can take the bus to Itäkeskus shopping mall in just 6-7 minutes and enjoy the plus 100 shops, 30 cafés and restaurants and the only IMAX screen cinema in Finland.
            We are a family who loves to travel and who know from experience what travellers expect of a good accomodation. We provide personal service and make sure that every guest is comfortably settled in. We have run Casa Roihu, a similar property since November 2018 with excellent results and now strive hard to make Casa Tanko your new favourite location in Helsinki.
            Tankomäki is a new, modern area about 2 kilometres east of Itäkeskus. It is easily connectable on a bus from the airport or the metro and bus from the centre of Helsinki.
